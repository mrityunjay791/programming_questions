Every class should have a single responsibility, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class.
There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.

The Single Responsibility Principle represents the “S” of the five SOLID Principles of object-oriented programming to write well-designed code that is more readable, maintainable,
and easier to upgrade and modify.


Note that in the above code, the responsibility of EmailService is separated 
from UserService so now UserService does its re

Responsibility related user operations and EmailService does it's responsibility related email operations.
