Open Closed Principle Example
Let's take the same example of Database Connection Provider, ideal we can have a connection to any RDBMS data source as per our requirements.
Let's design or develop source code using this design principle.
Code for the interface so first create IConnetionProvider interface and create a separate class to implement this interface for each database connection like H2ConnectionProvider, MySQLConnectionProvider.
In future, if Client wants to connect MS-Server or Oracle then we need to create the class like MsServerConnectionProvider or OracleConnectionProvider and just implement IConnectionProviderinterface that's it.
we are not modifying existing code here, we are just extending as per our requirement.
